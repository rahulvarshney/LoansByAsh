  <h1><center>Why Should I Do a NO Cost loan?</center></h1>

  <h2><u><font color='blue'>How Can You Do A No Cost Loan?</font></u></h2>
  <p>
    I offer ALL my clients a NO COST loan by passing over lender credits in the form of a "Yield Spread Premium" to pay off closing cost fees.   This gives you, the borrower, the flexibility to refinance again at any given time.
  </p>

  <h2><u><font color='blue'>Are You Sure I Will Refinance Again?</font></u></h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you will!  Every Client of mine has refinanced to a lower rate.  Often, banks will need to fill a certain quota for the month and will drop rates just for one day.  With my monitoring system, you will be locked into a Better Rate and Never pay a Cent.   There are a multitude of other reasons to refinance again:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may Change  your <u><font color='red'>Loan Program</font></u> - (Ex. Sell your home & lower your rate by moving from a 30 year Fix to a 15 Year Fix).</li>
    <li>You may Change your <u><font color='red'>Payment Option</font></u> - (Ex. Move to an Interest Only payment for better cash flow).</li>
    <li>You may take <i>Cash Out</i> for a vacation, a new car, downpayment on an investment property, or simply to consolidate credit card debts.</li>
    <li>And Of Course, You may want to keep the same program but just <i>Lower Your Rate!</i></li>
  </ul>

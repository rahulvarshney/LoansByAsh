  <h2>Tax Benefits of Home Ownership</h2>
  <h4><u><font color='navy'>What is Tax Deductible?</font></u></h4>
  <ol>
    <li>ALL Interest Payments of up to One Million Dollars on a Home Mortgage Loan!</li>
    <li>ALL the Interest Payments of up to $100,000 on a Home Equity Loan! (even if you don't use the money for home improvements)</li>
    <li>ALL your Real Estate Property Taxes!</li>
    <li>ALL your Closing Costs (if you choose NOT to do a NO COST loan)</li>
  </ol>
    <u><b>Example:</b></u>
  <p><i>Bob rents a home at a cost of $2,200.00 per month. He is single with no children and takes the standard deduction on his income taxes. His adjusted gross income is $105,000. He has $3,500 in state income tax withheld from his paychecks throughout the year, but doesn't qualify for any other itemized deductions. Bob's federal income tax liability for 2008 will look something like this:</i></p>

<table border='2'>
  <tr>
    <td>Adjusted gross income</td><td>$105,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less standard deduction, Single</td><td>$4,400</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less Personal Exemption</td><td>$2,800</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Taxable income</td><td>$97,800</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bob's Federal income tax</td><td>$21,502</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
<p><i>However, if Bob purchases a home with a monthly mortgage payment of $2,200, his tax liability is lowered. At the end of the year Bob will receive a form 1098 from his mortgage company that shows how much of his mortgage payments for the year went to mortgage interest. Bob's 1098 shows that he paid $26,400 in mortgage interest. Bob also paid $6,875 in real estate taxes on his home. Bob's federal income tax liability will look something like this:</i></p>

    <td>Taxable income</td><td>$65,425</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Bob's Federal income tax</td><td>$12,780</td>

<ul>
  <li>Bob saved $8,722 in federal income taxes! (not to mention his savings in State Taxes)</li>
  <li>Bob's Monthly Housing Cost ($2200) Stayed The Same!</li>
  <li>Bob Is Gaining Equity on the Appreciation of His Home!</li>

<font color='navy'><u>Capital Gains Tax</u></font>


<p>A single person can sell their primary residence and pocket $250,000 of the sale profits without paying taxes to Uncle Sam.  A married couple can pocket $500,000 and pay Zero Capital Gains Tax.  This exemption is applicable every Two Years...And you do NOT need to use the sale profits towards the purchase of a more expensive home.
***But, do NOT forget to pay recapture tax on any depreciation you have claimed while the property was a Rental!</p>

<p>1.  You must prove that you have resided in your home for at least two of the last five years.  (Mailing address, address on record with the IRS, utilities accounts in your name are ways of proving residency).  The two years can be but do not need to be consecutive years.
2.  Another property cannot have been sold as a principal residence within two years prior to the current sale. Nor can another one be sold until two years after.
</p>

<u><font color='navy'>Some Examples Of What You CAN Do:</font></u>
<ul>
  <li>Rent your home for five years, move back in for 2 years, sell and pay no capital gains tax.</li>
  <li>Live in your home for 3 years, rent it for 3 years, sell and pay no capital gains tax.</li>
  <li>If the home was lived in for 2 years, then rented for 3 years and a day, technically the owner must move back in before selling to avoid tax on the gain.</li>
</ul>

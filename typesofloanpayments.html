  <h2><center>Two Types of Loan Payments</center></h2>

  <h4><font color='navy'><u>Interest Only:</u></font></h4>

<p>Your payment is the simple Interest to the bank.  You do NOT pay Principal, so your loan balance remains the same.  If you put a large sum of money towards your balance, your Payment will Decrease.  <a href='https://lba408.weebly.com/interest-only.html'><font color='red'>(Click Here To Calculate Your Interest Only Payment)</font></a>

  <h4><font color='navy'><u>Principal & Interest:</u></font></h4>

  <p>Your payment is the simple Interest to the bank + a Principal payment.  This Principal payment is a Forced payment designed to payoff your loan in 30 years.  If you put a large sum of money towards your balance, your payment does NOT decrease.  Instead, you simply payoff your loan quicker than 30 years.  <a href='https://lba408.weebly.com/principal--interest.html'><font color='red'>(Click Here To Calculate Your Principal & Interest Payment)</font></a>

  <h4><font color='navy'><u>Which Type Of Payment Is Better?</u></font></h4>

  <p>Interest Only is definitely better.  By having the option of paying principal, you have the flexibility of a lower monthly payment.  Your payment Re-Casts every time your balance changes.  A common misconception is that Interest Only means your loan balance won't drop. Not True! As long as you have NO Prepayment Penalty, you can always add a Principal balance to pay your loan off in 30 years.  The Only Negative to Interest Only is that it often entails a slightly higher Interest Rate.</p>

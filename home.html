As a trusted mortgage specialist, my goal was to provide a solution for removing these fees. I have succesfully formulated a clever way of doing business that has received 100% Positive Feedback!</p>

  <p>I simply <b><i>Monitor</i></b> ALL my client's files Daily, and if there ever is an opportunity to Lower your Rate at NO Cost... I will Lock Your Rate & Immediately Notify You!  The market is highly volatile, so how can you be assured that you are getting the right rate at the right time?

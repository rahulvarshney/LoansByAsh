<h1><center>Conforming & Jumbo Loans</center></h1>

<h3><u><font color='navy'>Conforming Loans:</font></u></h3>

<p>Conforming loans have terms and conditions that follow the guidelines set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The Conforming Limit changes every year.  The conforming limit is at $463,450, and generally has Better Rates and easier qualifications than a Jumbo Loan.  In cases of strong equity and credit scores, an interior appraisal, paystubs, tax returns, and W2's may Not be required.</p>


<h3><u><font color='navy'>High-Balance Conforming Loans:</font></u></h3>

<p>High Balance Confiorming Loans allow for a Major Jump in Loan Limits upto $679,650 for eligible states.  Though, these are technically Conforming Limits - they have additional adjustments to the Conforming rates when the loan size ranges between $463,450 - $679,650.  Therefore, the rates are not as attractive as the Conforming loans at the $463,450 amount.</p>

<h3><u><font color='navy'>Jumbo Loans:</font></u></h3>

<p>Jumbo (Non-Conforming) Loans are when the loan amount exceeds the Conformit Limit threshold.  These loans are less likely to be sold or transferred to another bank, and the risk factor to portfolio the loan is the reason for the higher interest rate.  Any loan size above $679,650 is considered to be a Jumbo Loan.</p>
